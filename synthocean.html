            <h2>What is synthocean?</h2>
            <p>Our planet is encased in ocean and has highly active volcanoes 
                that spew out gaseous mixtures of carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur 
                dioxide, hydrogen sulfides, and nitrogen oxides. Due to the abundant 
                amounts of water on its surface and its relatively high concentration 
                of greenhouse gases, our planet experiences high amounts of precipitation. 
                Rain captures the gaseous compounds in the atmosphere and leaches phosphorous 
                from the volcanic rocks, carrying many elements essential to life as it 
                enters the oceans. Over the course of the planet's geologic history, various 
                life forms have evolved from the most nascent molecular interactions that 
                occurred within the chemical environment of its hydrosphere.

            <p>Named after its 8 toes and its signature brightly colored sensors, the Octoflora 
                is a nitrifying organism. It converts nitrogen dioxide to nitrogen trioxide in the 
                presence of oxygen.

            <h2>2d simulation</h2>
            <p>This 2d simulation demonstrates the concepts behind the environment. We wanted 
                to build a habitat with areas that producers are more likely to spawn, indicted 
                by the green circles. Because the producers are more likely to spawn there, the 
                consumers form "communities" where they gather fight over resources. The more 
                hungry consumers win.

            <h2>3d simulation</h2>
            <p>This 3d simulation demonstrates the graphics and the environment. Here we have rain 
                clouds that put sulfuric acid into the ocean environment. The producers use the sulfate 
                and other chemicals to produce chemical energy. The consumers move randomly until they 
                detect the producer and start moving towards them to eat them.

            <p>Sulfur dioxide is spontaneously oxidized to sulfate as it is

                Sulfate can be used as a terminal electron acceptor in cell respiration.
